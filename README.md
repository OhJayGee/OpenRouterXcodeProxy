# OpenRouter Proxy for Xcode 26 Beta

This project creates a proxy for OpenRouter that modifies API responses to work with Xcode 26 beta as a model provider. The proxy transforms OpenRouter responses to match OpenAI's format, which is required by Xcode's native AI integration.

## Features
- `/models` endpoint returns models in OpenAI format
- `/chat/completions` endpoint proxies requests directly to OpenRouter
- Containerized with Docker
- Standalone pre-compiled executable

## Setup

### Docker Deployment
#### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)
1. Create docker-compose.yml (already created in project)
2. Start the service:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

To use a different host port (e.g., 9090):
```bash
HOST_PORT=9090 docker-compose up
```

#### Option 2: Manual Docker Commands
1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t openrouter-proxy ./proxy
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run --rm -p ${HOST_PORT:-8080}:8080 openrouter-proxy
```

### Standalone Executable Deployment
1. Make the build script executable:
```bash
chmod +x build_executable.sh
```

2. Build the standalone executable:
```bash
./build_executable.sh
```

3. Run the executable (default port 8080):
```bash
./proxy/dist/app
```

To run on a different port (e.g., 9090):
```bash
PORT=9090 ./proxy/dist/app
```

## Environment Variables

- `DISABLE_SSL_VERIFY`: Set to 'true' to disable SSL verification (useful for debugging with proxies like Charles). Default: SSL verification is enabled.
- `MODEL_FILTER_FILE`: Set to the absolute path of a text file containing allowed model IDs (one per line). If set, the `/v1/models` endpoint will only return models whose IDs are in this file.

## Xcode Setup

- Setting > Intelligence > Add a Model Provider...
    - URL: http://localhost:8080
    - API Key: Bearer sk-...
    - API Key Header: Authorization
    - Description: OpenRouter

## Troubleshooting

1. Logging: The proxy supports logging to stdio, so you can see Xcode's prompts and tool use and Swift Macro prompting. 
2. Xcode and available models:
   - Xcode might error when having to load the entire unfiltered model list from openrouter.
   - Once everything works you will see the available model list in two places in the Xcode UI:
     - Intelligence Tab: drop down for models with the heading "Openrouter"
     - Intelligence Setting: when clicking on the model provider "Openrouter" you see a list all available models, and you can enable the models you want to use, or even favorite the models you like most for coding.

3. Providing additional context with Apple Documentation (i.e. as MD) helps models to deal with modern Swift Dialects (Swift 6)
4. Instruct your model to write an Architecture and Design document, a requirements documents and an implementation plan, then have the models do coding/testing.

## Using with Proxyman (Debugging Proxy)

When using a debugging proxy like Proxyman, you might encounter SSL certificate verification errors. To resolve this:

1. Set the `DISABLE_SSL_VERIFY` environment variable to `true`:
```bash
# For Docker Compose
DISABLE_SSL_VERIFY=true docker-compose up

# For standalone executable
DISABLE_SSL_VERIFY=true ./proxy/dist/app
```

2. Trust Proxyman's root certificate in your system keychain (macOS):
   - Open Proxyman
   - Go to Certificate â†’ Install Certificate on This Mac...
   - Follow prompts to add to System keychain
   - Open Keychain Access, find "Proxyman" certificate
   - Double-click it, expand Trust, and set "When using this certificate" to "Always Trust"

**Important Security Note:** Disabling SSL verification should only be done for debugging purposes. Never use this in production environments as it makes connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Usage
- Get models in OpenAI format: `GET http://localhost:8080/models` (include your OpenRouter API key in the Authorization header)
- Use chat completions: `POST http://localhost:8080/chat/completions` with your request payload and Authorization header
